# Exploring Phenotypic Preferences in Male *Danio Rerio*

One of the least understood phenomena in modern animal behavior is that of the male’s choice in mating. A fundamentally important way of determining these preferences is the presentation of extremes and the *Danio* system provides an ideal way of exploring these through the use of GloFish® of a range of colors. These files look at the preference of wild-type males for red and green females against wild-type females.

HowToGit: This folder is to introduce all collaborators to the fundamentals of git and GitHub. These materials are taken from http://github.com/QuantitativeBiodiversity and the credit belongs solely to the Lennon Lab and all contributors therein (Dr. Jay Lennon, PhD; Dr. Ken Locey, PhD; Mr. Mario Muscarella, PhD Candidate; et al.)

data: This contains all of the data that has been generated in this lab in simplified format to best cooperate with R. There are csv and Excel copies of each. 

RedData is a raw display of the red data in order and sorted by which male was used in the trial. 

GreenData is the same raw display, but for the trails performed using green females.

RedMeans groups the trials on a single male together to avoid artificial inflation of n. 

GreenMeans does the same as RedMeans, but for the green data.

scripts: This will contain all R scripts that are used to analyze the data. They will be named by what they are doing (broadly), the date of creation, and the initials of the creator. Pull requests are expected to update the “Last Modified” section in the script or will be rejected.
